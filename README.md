The Workable Ticket Dashboard displays the workable tickets generated by a company's Case Management Tool that needs to be resolve by both the Accounts Payable and 
Vendor Admin Teams.

management can make decisions like reassigning some of the task that is over the teams SLA (Standard Level of Agreement).

This project will use bar charts to show comparative data and filtering data by clicking on the charts with the use of Crossfilter library.
